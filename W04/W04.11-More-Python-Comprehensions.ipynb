    "In Python, list and dictionary comprehensions are concise and readable ways to create lists and dictionaries. These comprehensions can replace more verbose for-loops, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand. Comprehensions are not only more syntactically clean but often faster in execution, especially for larger data sets (and, in upcoming Python 3.12, they will be even faster!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "A list comprehension allows you to generate a new list by applying an expression to each element in an existing list (or other iterable objects, like tuples, sets, and so on). The basic syntax of a list comprehension is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `expression`: What to evaluate and place in the new list.\n",
    "- `item`: Variable that takes the value of each element in the iterable during each loop iteration.\n",
    "- `iterable`: The collection of items to iterate over.\n",
    "- `condition`: Optional. An `if` statement for filtering items out of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Squaring each element in a list**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squared_numbers = [x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary comprehensions are similar to list comprehensions but are used to construct dictionaries. The basic syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{key: value for item in iterable if condition}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `key`: The key for the new dictionary.\n",
    "- `value`: The value to associate with the key.\n",
    "- `item`: Variable that takes the value of each element in the iterable during each loop iteration.\n",
    "- `iterable`: The collection of items to iterate over.\n",
    "- `condition`: Optional. An `if` statement for filtering items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Creating a dictionary with numbers as keys and their squares as values**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squared_dict = {x: x ** 2 for x in range(5)}\n",
